## Overview

Transfer USDC between any EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon).

## Example Routes

- Base → Ethereum
- Ethereum → Polygon
- Arbitrum → Base

## Quick Example

```typescript
const result = await bridge.transfer({
  from: 'BASE',
  to: 'POLYGON',
  amount: '100.00',
  recipient: '0x...',
  permit: signedPermit
})
```

## Same-Chain Transfers

For same-chain transfers (e.g., Base → Base):

```typescript
const result = await bridge.transfer({
  from: 'BASE',
  to: 'BASE',
  amount: '100.00',
  recipient: '0x...',
  permit: signedPermit
})
```

<Note>
  Same-chain transfers are faster and have lower fees.
